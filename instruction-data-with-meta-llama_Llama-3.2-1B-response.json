        "summary": "This Python code defines a function `init_hdf5` that initializes an HDF5 file for storing data. The function takes three parameters: `file_path`, `mode`, and `cam_type`. \n\n- `file_path`: The path to the HDF5 file.\n- `mode`: The mode in which the file is opened, either \"w\" (write mode) or \"r\" (read mode).\n- `cam_type`: A string indicating the type of camera, defaulting to \"davis\".\n\nThe function uses the `h5py` library to handle HDF5 files. It also imports a logger from the `spiker.log` module.\n\nHere's what happens in the function:\n\n1. If the mode is \"w\" (write mode):\n   - The function opens an HDF5 file at the specified path.\n   - It creates three groups: \"dvs\", \"extra\", and \"aps\" if the camera type is \"davis\".\n   - It also creates another group called \"imu\".\n\n2. If the mode is \"r\" (read mode):\n   - The function opens an HDF5 file at the specified path in read mode.\n\nThe function returns the dataset object, which can be used to interact with the HDF5 file.\n\nThis setup is typically used for storing data from a camera system, where different types of data (like DVS events, extra information, and sensor data) are organized into separate groups within the HDF5 file.",
